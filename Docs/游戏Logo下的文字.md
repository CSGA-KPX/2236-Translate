`I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I, and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been changed for Mabel! I'll try and say "How doth the little--"' and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--

             `How doth the little crocodile
               Improve his shining tail,
             And pour the waters of the Nile
               On every golden scale!

             `How cheerfully he seems to grin,
               How neatly spread his claws,
             And welcome little fishes in
               With gently smiling jaws!'

`I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!" I shall only look up and say "Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their heads down! I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'

“我敢肯定我不是艾达，”她说，“因为她是长长的鬈发，而我的头发一点儿都
不卷。我也敢说我不是梅布尔，因为我几乎什么都知道，而她，哼！什么也不
知道！而且，她是‘她’，我是‘我’，还有……噢，天啊，太难了！我要再试试，
看我还记不记得以前知道的东西。我想想：四乘以五等于十二，四乘以六等于
十三，四乘以七等于……噢！这样算下去我永远也算不到二十！不过，乘法表
并不重要，我们来试试地理吧。伦敦是巴黎的首都，巴黎是罗马的首都，罗马
是……不对，不对，都不对，我确定！我肯定变成梅布尔了！我要再背一背
《小鳄鱼该怎么……》。”她把双手交叉放在膝盖上，就好像正在背书，然后
开始背诵起来，可是她的声音听起来嘶哑又奇怪，吐字也跟往常不一样：
小鳄鱼该怎么做呀，
才能保养他闪亮的尾巴？
用尼罗河中的水，
冲洗每片金色的鳞甲！
他咧嘴笑得多开心啊，
他灵巧地伸出他的利爪，
他用温柔的微笑，
欢迎小鱼游进嘴巴！
“我肯定背得不对。”可怜的爱丽丝说着，眼里又充满了泪水，“我肯定变成梅
布尔了，我得去住破旧的小房子了，而且就要没有玩具可以玩了。还有，噢！
有那么多功课要学！不，我决定了，如果我是梅布尔，我就待在这下面！就算
他们把头伸下来说：‘上来吧，宝贝儿！’我也只会抬头看看，然后说：‘我到底
是谁？先告诉我。’如果我喜欢当这个人，我就上去；如果不喜欢，我就一直
待在下面，直到我变成另一个人再说。可是，噢！”爱丽丝的眼泪突然夺眶而
出，“我真希望他们现在就来叫我！我已经受够了一直待在这儿了！”
