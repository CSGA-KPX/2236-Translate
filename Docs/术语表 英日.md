## 18-Dimensional Space Theory / 18 次元宇宙論

18-Dimensional Space Theory: The theory which states that the universe is an 18-
dimensional space, by way of Superposition Science. C.S. advocated this because in order for 
the HT Infrastructure Theory to be established, the universe had to be an 18-dimensional 
space.

## Akashic Phone(s) / アカシック・フォーン
Akashic Phone(s): Refers to the tomes that detail all scientific knowledge, culture, history 
before Paradigm Lost, as well as the science and history left on Earth afterwards. While it is 
unknown just how long it took to enumerate that much information, given the fact that it’s said 
to be enough to fill up an entire city, then it’s assumed that it must have been continuously 
written for years upon years. The only things left to serve as a record of the Earth before 
Paradigm Lost are the books of the Akashic Phone series. Every book circulating around the 
world is a copy of the original tomes, and there are currently versions that take it a step further 
and have digitized the data. One theory states that the original Akashic Phones are stored in 
the city known as The Archive. The colors of the covers of the original versions are said to all 
be a uniform shade of red.

Artificial Intelligence (A.I.): In the 23rd century, advanced forms of A.I. that possess cognitive 
thought nearly on par with humans were created. The basic theory was constructed from the 
“Improper Studies” developed during the 21st Century, and their personalities  are determined 
by the variety of axiom selected for them. They are used in numerous different fields due to 
their ability to effectively communicate with humans. In recent years, along with the 
development of organic robotic engineering, humanoids that replicate nearly all human 
characteristics barring HT and reproductive capabilities have been ushered in, but after much 
scathing criticism from bioethics organizations and labor unions, laws have been established 
that obligate all artificial intelligence and robots to be distinct from humans, not given human 
rights, and presented in a way that makes them clearly recognizable as robots or A.I. Recently, 
Personal A.I. Secretary Systems have become very popular and have been integrated into 
people's lives as reliable partners.

Disc Course (Disc Course Shooter): The Disc Course Shooter is a 23rd-century form of 
public transportation. By reservation, you can freely designate your pick-up station, time, and 
drop-off station. The huge discs it uses are a defining characteristic, and it flies along the 
direction-indicating rails. Its main principle of flight is that its discs create a force field which 
gives it lift off the ground. In addition, there hasn’t been a single accident since it started 
operation since, due to its design, it never comes into contact with other trains.

The above is what is referred to as Euler's identity. The special case puts together the base of 
natural logarithm 𝑒, trigonometic constant π, imaginary unit i, multiplication unit element 1, and 
addition unit element 0, helping bridge several different fields of mathematics. That is also the 
reason why it is referred to as “The Most Beautiful Equation.”

Format: Process that utilizes common display methods in order for both parties involved in 
telepathic communication to hold and take information. When having a telepathic conversation, 
in most cases, it is conducted after having the information formatted into language. This is due 
in part to unformatted information not being suited towards conversation, since only things 
such as colors and states of excitement can be transmitted without being formatted. When 
telepathically transmitting to life-forms that have no language of their own, formatting the 
information goes about in a completely different way, so it’s not likely that any advanced 
exchange of information can be had.

Gate: The organ, function, and/or mechanism related to telepathy perceived to be in the 
human brain. When people make a telepathic transmission, both of their Gates must be open. 
Due to the phenomenon known as telepathy having a nature which only allows it to be 
recursively observed via telepathy itself, and while there is no clear explanation on how Gates 
function, a rough estimate from observation of brainwaves and blood flow is that it lies 
somewhere in a part of the brain. It is assumed that life-forms with brains and/or nerve centers 
such as animals also possess Gates, but it is theoretically impossible to prove that true or not.

HT: Short for Holding Task or Holding & Taking. HT Phenomenon. A propagation phenomenon 
originating from higher-dimensional space, or the theory attached to it. In 2033, C.S. 
advocated the HT Infrastructure Theory. This theory states that there exists a path for data to 
pass through within all objects, and by using that path as an intermediary, we can hold and 
take in said data. The “data” in this case being the waves of particles referred to as “HT 
Particles.” Due to the movement of particles within a partial cloud space that is incompatible 
with a pre-directional dimension space, all HT-linked phenomenon, including HT Particles, are 
impossible to observe on a physics-level (as they are physically invisible.) In addition, 
Superposition Geometry has been utilized to describe the HT Infrastructure Theory. In 
Superposition Geometry, in order to describe a space, we expand upon the concept of a 
“dimension” as it is defined to us in the terms of the more familiar Euclidean Geometry. The HT 
Infrastructure Theory, by utilizing Euclidean Geometry, and excluding any special cases, 
proves that HT phenomena are physically invisible. In addition, springboarding off of this, multi-
dimensional space theories such as the 18th Dimensional Space Theory have been actively 
advocated. The communication method known more commonly as Telepathy can convey data 
(I.E. language, any of the five senses, thoughts) by having HT Particles going from one human’s 
Gate to another and being processed as such. This is very much linked to ghostly phenomena, 
and, historically speaking, HT was developed by chance while conducting an experiment into 
the research of ghostly phenomena. Based on research, it is believed that the sensory organs 
to govern HT have always existed in the minds of the human race, but that they had remained 
degenerate until HT was discovered in recent years. 


Telepathy has become a means of 
communication for life-forms devoid of language, all due to the fact that telepathic 
communication is possible with animals, or basically life-forms that possess a brain or nerve 
center. Stemming from this, the commonly accepted theory is that almost all lifeforms, 
including humans, have communicated through telepathy since ancient times. Humans were 
the only ones to develop language and replace telepathy, eventually leading to the downfall of 
telepathic communication as a whole. A majority of paranormal phenomena that occurred 
before HT was scientifically explained can be logically explained via the HT Infrastructure 
Theory.

NSL Method: Short for No Signal Locator Method. A method of coding GPS transmissions into 
usable data. By using the data coursing through canals and HT, it's possible to get a general 
location of a specific point placed on the canalways. It mainly serves useful when trying to 
detect underdeveloped waterways. Since it utilizes HT, human beings will end up reading 
(sensing) the data from the canals, but they must remember a rather complicated and vast 
code sheet to do anything with it. In addition, the accuracy of this method will vary greatly 
based on one’s power to read HT and their sense for unformatted data. The reason why it is 
referred to as “no signal” is because the method finds location data and/or canals that don’t 
have any formatted location data in them.  

NSL 方式[No Signal of Locator method] ……無信号位置特定方式。GPS 通信の情報符号

coming out that say that it has the possibility to help early childhood mental development by 
stating it as “a partner by your side till the very end” and “a partner that will show you the way 
when you’re lost.”

Rainbow: A phenomenon in which spectrum-colored bands spread concentrically in the sky. 
Rainbows show geometric features in the way the bands break apart when they disappear. 
Utilizing mathematics, they can be explained as below: 
 
𝑥 = 𝑐𝑜𝑠4 𝑡 , 𝑦 = 𝑠𝑖𝑛4(𝑡)	…	(∗) 
 
By making the radius of the outermost circle r=R, the ring around r=R/2 is expressed as n=1 for 
(*). As r becomes smaller than R/2, n's value approaches infinity. On the other hand, if n's value 
increases, it approaches 0, breaking down and disappearing as such. It’s an unexpected 
naturally occurring phenomenon that is rarely observed.

Smart Tools: A type of personal computer terminal that has come into popularity in the 23rd 
century. Strictly speaking, a Smart Tool is a terminal capable of topological shape-shifting, 
composed from Alternative High Molecular gel. Extremely popular in recent years, they are 
referred to as being "soft devices", and can turn into several different forms so long as the 
needed molecular construction definition files are present. Due to the outer membranes being 
completely sealed off, the inner battery is non-exchangeable, giving them a life-span of about 
5-6 years.

Spring Motion: Reference to simple harmonic oscillation. Harmonic oscillation is motion that 
draws out the one-dimensional components of circular motion. For example, if we make the 
radius of a circle A, the angular velocity ω and time t, the position of the body in harmonic 
oscillation would be displayed via the following equation: 
x=Asin(ωt) 
In addition, by differentiating this twice over, it will lead us to the equation of motion ma=-Kx 
(with m and a being the mass and acceleration of the object in motion, and K being the 
constant.) A key feature of an object in harmonic oscillation is that, as shown by the above 
equation, its location determines the amount of power put into it. The equation of motion for 
the object attached to the spring of the spring constant k is represented with ma=-kx. Thus, 
spring motion is equivalent to simple harmonic oscillation.

The Archive: The city which stores the original set of Akashic Phone books. However, that city 
has gone undiscovered on Earth, and is considered to be merely fictional. Going off of the fact 
that the Akashic Phones have their contents passed on and known to the modern age, there is 
no denying that they exist, but, in regards to the existence of the original tomes, there are 
many an archeologist who are skeptical. There are many testimonies from people who have 
said they have visited The Archive, but none of these accounts are credible. It is said that, in 
The Archive, there is an extremely vast collection of Akashic Phone books lined up neatly on 
gigantic bookshelves.
